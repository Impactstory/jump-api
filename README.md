## Unsub and Open Source

The Unsub application is open source. We think it's important that users can inspect code underlying the Unsub application. There are however two important distinctions from other open source software you may be familiar with. First, we are not able to accept code contributions. We are a small team and it takes time to manage community contributions. Second, Unsub can not be run on its own. There is a significant component of user supplied data, as well as data curated in house, making it only possible to operate as a hosted application.
